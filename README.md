## Background

#### WHY BUILD THIS?

What we do makes up who we are.

The problem: Our accomplishments don't really "live anywhere" where we can prove them, show them, and share them.

And if they do exist online, they're fragmented. Our career history is on LinkedIn. Our travel history is on Instagram. My PADI Scuba certification is a plastic card in my wallet. A few digital platforms have accrued the ultimate "power of endorsement" (blue checkmarks).

What if we were able to collect our experiences and accomplishments in a central place? What if the community involved in those experiences could issue them? And what if those accomplishments were totally trustworthy and provable?

#### OUR SOLUTION

A protocol for communities to issue proof of completion/endorsement for anything. Imagine a world where organizations can issue and govern their own blue checkmarks.

What's included:

- Token standard: open source ERC1155 Non-Tradeable token standard for communities to create, govern, mint, and manage the certifications that matter to them. (This repo).
- Community dapp (web2): client app for community token management, optional custodial wallet service, and metadata storage. Not required, but a method for less web3 savvy communities to create and manage their tokens without having to worry about wallets and crypto complexity.
- User dapp (web2): client app to view your Soulbound Tokens, prove ownership.

## Project North Stars

- Communities can issue provable certifications and endorsements to use for anything
- People have central control over their certifications and endorsements
- No fancy crypto stuff. Make this easy, delightful, and useful.

## How it works

1. **Streamers customize and mint their Loot Set (on-chain):** Streamer is authenticated via Twitch Oauth and then can customize their set. Donation events are mapped to a token that streamers can customize name and logo for. Channel subscriptions are mapped to NFTs that streamers can customize name, image, and tenure (awarding after x months subbed). Standard Loot Sets include 1 token and 3 NFTs. Uses ERC1155 token standard to encompass all loot into a single contract. Streamers can decide to mint a portion of tokens for themselves at initial contract creation.
2. **Server listens for and saves on-Twitch donation and sub events (centralized):** after minting their Loot Set, Streamers provide necessary Twitch API eventsub permissions so our server can begin listening for events and logging them. All donation and channel subscription events are saved to a centralized database and not minted on chain yet.
3. **Viewers mint their rewards when they'd like:** viewers can log into Stream Loot (via Twitch Oauth) to view their current Stream Loot--both minted and un-minted. If a viewer chooses, they can mint any available Stream Loot by making a server request (which signs the transaction with a private key), and in turn call mint()/mintBatch() on the Stream Loot Polygon smart contract. The contract verifies the signature, and mints the Stream Loot if all conditions are met.
4. **Viewers are free to trade and spend rewards:** viewers can interact with and swap their loot directly with the on-chain contracts. Stream Loot also provides a front end for easy contract interaction.

## Structure

## Contract addresses

#### Polygon (Main Net)

- _StreamLootFactory.sol:_ TBD
- _StreamLoot.sol:_ TBD

#### Test (Polygon - Mumbai)

- _StreamLootFactory.sol:_ TBD
- _StreamLoot.sol:_ TBD

## Local setup

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/brianwatroba/stream-loot.git`
2. Install base project dependencies: cd into root, run `npm install`
3. Add local .env file to project root. Include below env variables (replace keys with your own):

```bash
/.env

ALCHEMY_API_KEY=XXX
POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
```

## Usage

1. Front end (on localhost): finish this later
2. Local testing: tests written in Chai/Mocha using Hardhat/Ethers.js. Run `npx hardhat test` for test suite.
3. Deployment to Polygon Test (Mumbai): ensure your .env file includes your Rinkeby private key. Then run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon-mumbai`. Deploy script only deploys the ProjectFactory.sol contract.
4. Deployment to other test nets: add your desired network to the `networks` object in `hardhat-config.js` using the following format:

```javascript
/hardhat.config.js

polygon: {
      url: `https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2${process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [`${process.env.POLYGON_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY}`],
    },
```
